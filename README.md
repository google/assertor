Assertor
========
Assertor makes test assertions and failure messages more human-readable.

Assertor is heavily affected by [Java Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) in terms of API design and error messages,
but this is a totally different project from Java Truth.

### Disclaimer

This is not an official Google product, it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.

âš  The API is not fully stable and may be changed until version 1.0.

Example
-------

```rust
use assertor::*;

#[test]
fn test_it() {
    assert_that!("foobarbaz").contains("bar");
    assert_that!("foobarbaz").ends_with("baz");

    assert_that!(0.5).with_abs_tol(0.2).is_approx_equal_to(0.6);

    assert_that!(vec!["a", "b"]).contains("a");
    assert_that!(vec!["a", "b"]).has_length(2);
    assert_that!(vec!["a", "b"]).contains_exactly(vec!["a", "b"]);

    assert_that!(Option::Some("Foo")).has_value("Foo");
}
```

### Failure cases

```rust
use assertor::*;

fn test_it() {
    assert_that!(vec!["a", "b", "c"]).contains_exactly(vec!["b", "c", "d"]);
    // missing (1)   : ["d"]
    // unexpected (1): ["a"]
    // ---
    // expected      : ["b", "c", "d"]
    // actual        : ["a", "b", "c"]
}
```

## Feature ideas

- [ ] Color / Bold
- [ ] Better diff: vec
- [ ] Better diff: set
- [ ] Better diff: HashMap
